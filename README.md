# Rationale

After beginning to read Atul Gawandes great book [The Checklist Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto)
I decided to give checklists a serious try. Obviously they can help prevent deaths, so I thought maybe they can help me remember important
stuff as well. But carrying around pen and paper isn't working out for me. I want to have those lists on my phone and on all of my computers.
ClojureCup gives me the perfect excuse to write myself an app aimed at my 'personal check list needs'.

## Usage

FIXME

## What's missing

- Multi user support, right now everyone can add and change check lists. 
- Reordering of checklist items.
